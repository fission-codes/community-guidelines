# Code of Conduct

**TL;DR Be kind, inclusive, and considerate.**

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment, all
attendees, organizers, contributors, volunteers, speakers, sponsors, and
mployees at [Causal Islands][causal-islands] pledge to accept and observe the
following Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is in effect throughout the
conference, including within associated online communities, (e.g. Discord, and
elsewhere leading up to and after the event). Cooperation from everyone will
help ensure a safe environment for all.

Causal Islands is for anyone interested in exploring, learning, and forming
connections about and through the future of computing while doing so in a fun,
engaging and respectful environment.

Our conference is dedicated to being a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of background, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
religion (or lack thereof), or any other dimension of diversity.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue,
including talks, workshops, break-out rooms, conference-related social events,
conference-related online forums, and on social media. Be kind to others. Do not
insult or put down people within the community. Behave professionally. Remember
that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate
for Causal Islands. Conference participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the conference (including potential future events
hosted by Fission) without a refund at the discretion of the conference
organizers.

Causal Islands will post a transparency report after the conference to respond
to any incidents related-to or violations of the Code of Conduct that do occur.

## How to be at Causal Islands

We expect everyone to follow these rules at conference venues,
conference-related social events, and within associated online communities.
*Be kind, inclusive, and considerate*. Here are a few examples on how you can go
about doing that:

- Look for and read participants pronoun badges/stickers.
- Write your own pronoun badge/sticker.
- If there’s an opportunity to ask questions, ask constructive questions instead
  of trying to make a statement about your knowledge or work.
- Respect attendees’ boundaries, especially on what they choose to share or not
  share about themselves.

## Enforcement

Anyone asked to stop abusive, harassing, or otherwise unnacceptable behaviour
are expected to comply immediately and accept the response decided on by
conference organizers.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns related to abusive or unnacceptable behavior or content,
please contact a member of conference staff immediately or via email at
[support@fission.codes][support-email]. Conference staff will
be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement,
provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe
for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
